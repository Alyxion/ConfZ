ConfZ -- Pydantic Config Management
===================================

ConfZ is a configuration management library for Python based on `pydantic <https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/>`_.
It easily allows you to

* load your configuration from config files, environment variables, command line arguments and more sources
* transform the loaded data into a desired format and validate it
* access the results as Python dataclass-like objects with full IDE support

It furthermore supports you in common use cases like:

* Multiple environments
* Singleton with lazy loading
* Config changes for unit tests
* Custom config sources
